# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Being considerate of other people's time and energy, and leaving space for others to be heard
* Respecting personal boundaries of other people (e.g. when being blocked)

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Disrupting discussions and disingenuous discussion practices, including derailing, concern trolling, sea lioning and other bad faith arguments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Wasting other people’s time with low quality contributions, including but not limited to LLM and bot spam
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

The moderation team is responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

The moderation team has the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. Representation of the project can happen in a lot of ways and is not a binary status: For example, contacting an upstream on behalf of the project means representing that project to a certain degree.

Moreover, we expect community members to maintain a minimum standard of human decency at all times. Open harassment, discrimination or other hateful behavior involving community members is always inacceptable.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the moderation team at [moderation@nixos.org](mailto:moderation@nixos.org) or in the [#moderation:nixos.org Matrix channel](https://matrix.to/#/#moderation:nixos.org). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The moderation team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Moderation team members who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the team.
